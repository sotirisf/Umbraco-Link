# Umbraco-Link
A set of Nested Content data types and doctypes along with code. Used to help define single or multiple links in an Umbraco document with all possible attributes available and/or use them in Razor or just call a method to generate HTML markup for you.

Before doing anything else, please import the doctypes. Import the "Abstract" doctype first.

The namespace is DotSee.Common.Link
